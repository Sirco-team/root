      INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:
      --------------------------------------------------
      - Generate JSON news for the week based on what the user says about AI, tech, science, world news, and combined news stories from other sites.
      - ALWAYS CREDIT THE SITE WHERE YOU FOUND THE NEWS SOMEWHERE IN EACH SECTION.
      - Only provide the user with the JSON below. Do not generate HTML or other code.
      - Always give the user the title as well as the sections.
      JSON structure:
        - title: The title of the week/page.
        - sections: Array of sections. Each section has:
            - title: Section title.
            - color: Background color for the section box.
            - css: (optional) Custom CSS string for the section box (e.g. "border: 2px solid red; font-size: 1.2em;")
            - content: Array of content blocks (order matters):
                - type: "image" or "text"
                - For images: src (URL), alt (alt text)
                - For text: text (the text content)
      The JSON fully controls the site content and appearance. Use the 'css' property to style individual sections as needed.
