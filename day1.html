      INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:
      --------------------------------------------------
      - Generate JSON news for the week based on what the user says about AI, tech, science, world news, and combined news stories from other sites.
      - ALWAYS CREDIT THE SITE WHERE YOU FOUND THE NEWS SOMEWHERE IN EACH SECTION.
      - Only provide the user with the JSON below. Do not generate HTML or other code.
      - Always give the user the title as well as the sections.
      JSON structure:
        - title: The title of the week/page.
        - sections: Array of sections. Each section has:
            - title: Section title.
            - color: Background color for the section box.
            - css: (optional) Custom CSS string for the section box (e.g. "border: 2px solid red; font-size: 1.2em;")
            - content: Array of content blocks (order matters):
                - type: "image" or "text"
                - For images: src (URL), alt (alt text)
                - For text: text (the text content)
      The JSON fully controls the site content and appearance. Use the 'css' property to style individual sections as needed.

The new model is now available to ChatGPT users and promises better reasoning, coding, and creative writing. Altman also expressed a new concern, noting he's 'more worried about the 62-year-old than the 22-year-old' in the shifting job market, highlighting the importance of reskilling. Paid subscribers on the Pro plan ($200 per month) get unlimited access, while free users face new usage limits. The launch follows a new initiative by Idaho National Laboratory (INL) called TAIGR (Testing for AI Grid Resilience), aimed at mitigating the risks of AI-enhanced grid management systems. Meanwhile, the semiconductor industry continues its boom, with major players like Samsung, Nvidia, and AMD solidifying key partnerships. A new deal has been struck where Nvidia and AMD will pay 15% of their Chinese AI chip revenues to the US government in a bid to secure export licenses. In the medical field, BostonGene has won the 'AI-based Drug Discovery Solution of the Year' award for its platform that integrates tissue analytics with genomic and clinical data. *Sources: OpenAI, Times of India, INL, and Bloomberg.*"

Scientists at SLAC have unexpectedly created gold hydride, a compound of gold and hydrogen, while studying diamond formation under extreme pressure and heat. In other news, astronomers have identified what might be the largest black hole ever detected, a dormant beast weighing 36 billion solar masses. In marine biology, researchers at Virginia Tech are combining AI and citizen science to create a new platform called 'sharkPulse' that uses online photos to monitor shark populations in real time. On the health front, new research has found a shortcut to weight loss that avoids the common side effects of existing drugs like Ozempic. The new method targets brain support cells to produce appetite-suppressing molecules. *Sources: SciTechDaily, Tech Explorist, Virginia Tech News, and ScienceDaily.*"
